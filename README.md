# linkup
Developers: Woojoo Byun, Adrian Kyzer, Marcus Hilaire, Jon Telles

## Why linkup?

* As a person in 2018, I want MORE social media , so that I can absorb that sweet, sweet content and forget about my real-life problems.
* As someone who used to browse the internet back in the day, I want to discover more sites, so that I don’t have to only use Facebook/Twitter/Reddit/Tumblr.

## Concept
Description
* A mobile-friendly site that allows you to save links “in the cloud” and share them publicly or store them privately
* Follow other users and discover their favorite links
* Popularity tracking - see which links have the most clicks
* Category tracking - filter and store your links by category

Motivation
* To create a place to store everything on the internet that’s important to you in a simple and easy format
* To help share and surface lesser-known sites that provide excellent services but don’t get the attention they deserve
